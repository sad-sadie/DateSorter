# DateSorter

Implementation of sortDates method, with takes list of dates and sorts it in a specific way:
dates with an 'r' in the month, sorted ascending (first to last), then dates without an 'r' in the month, sorted descending (last to first). For example, October dates would come before May dates, because October has an 'r' in it.
I've added some comments and have written a few unit tests.
